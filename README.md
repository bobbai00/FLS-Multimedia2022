# FLS-Multimedia2022
This repository contains MATLAB R2022a (9.12.0.1884302, maci64 bit, February 16 2022) implementation of Flying Light Speck (FLS) concepts presented in our ACM Multimedia 2022 paper.  It includes the Rose Clip data set consisting of 115 point clouds with each point cloud requiring 65K FLSs to illuminate.

# Features

  * Two algorithms to deploy FLSs to illuminate a single point cloud:  MinDist and QuotaBalanced.
  * One algorithm to compute flight path of FLSs to illuminate motion illuminations consisting of a sequence of point clouds:  Motill.
  * All algorithms implemented using MATLAB R2022a academic edition. 
  * Rose Clip data set consisting of 115 point clouds.
  * The algorithms are detailed in a paper that appeared in the ACM Multimedia 2022 paper with an extended arXiv version.

# Documentation

This section describes how to run and benchmark algorithms for static and motion illumination in turn.

## Static Illuminations

We use the [Princeton Shape Benchmark](https://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/) to create static point clouds to evaluate MinDist and QuotaBalanced algorithms.  While the choice of this benchmark is somewhat arbitrary, we were motivated to use it for several reasons.  First, it contains a database of 3D polygonal models collected from the web.  Second, it consists of a large number of shapes.  Third, it provides existing software tools for evaluating shape-based retrieval and analysis algorithsm.  As a part of our future research direction, we intend to explore alternative retrieval techniques with FLS illuminations.  The benchmark and its existing software are a good comparison yardstick.  

Below, we describe how to create a point cloud from a Princeton 3D Shape Model.  Subsequently, we describe how to run the MinDist and QuotaBalanced algorithms.  This workflow is captured in the MATLAB file workflowMinDist.m.  It is trivial to change this file to execute QuotaBalanced (not provided). To execute the workflow, download the Princeton Shape Benchmark database and execute the workflowMinDist function using MATLAB's Command Window:
```
workflowMinDist(false, true)
```
Make sure to provide the path to a valid Princeton Benchmark file as input.  And, modify the value of PtCldFile variable (in workflowMinDist.m) to have the name of the file that should contain the point cloud file.

Here are the individual steps of the workflow file.  Create a point cloud from a Princeton 3D Model:
1. Download the Princeton Shape Benchmark dataset.
2. Make a copy of this git repository (shahramg/FLS_Multimedia2022) available to MATLAB.
3. Launch MATLAB and change directory (cd) to cnvPrincetonShapeToPtCloud folder of this repository.
4. Run cnvPrincetonShapeToPtCld(inputfile, outputfile) where inputfile is the path to a Princeton Shape file and outputfile is the path to the point cloud output file.  Example:  
```
cnvPrincetonShapeToPtCld('/Users/flyinglightspec/src/benchmark/db/15/m1559/m1559.off', './pt1559.ptcld')
```
4. Plot the resulting point cloud file using the provided plotPtCld function in cnvPrincetonShapeToPtCloud directory.  Example:  
```
plotPtCld('./pt1559.ptcld')
```
5. Verify the point cloud looks like the jpeg file provided by the Princeton Shape Benchmark.  Example:  see /Users/flyinglightspec/src/benchmark/db/15/m1559/m1559_thumb.jpg

Use readPrincetonFile function to create a MATLAB variable named vertexList that contains the vertices of the points in a point cloud file.  This MATLAB function is in the cnvPrincetonShapeToPtCloud directory.  Example:  
```
[vertexList, minW, maxW, minH, maxH, minD, maxD] = readPrincetonFile('pt1559.ptcld')
```

Return to the parent directory (cd ..) Run MinDist or QuotaBAlanced algorithm using the vertexList variable. Example:  
```
algMinDist(vertexList, false, false) 
```
or 
```
algQuotaBalanced(vertexList, false, false)
```
MinDist and QuotaBalanced implementations use an in-memory data structure to eliminate the overhead of secondary storage (disk/SSD/NVM) accesses to read a file into memory.  This is for benchmarking purposes.  All execution times reported in the ACM Multimedia 2022 publication is based on in-memory data structures.


## Motion Illuminations
We represent a motion illumination as a stream of point clouds that must be rendered at a pre-specified rate, e.g., 24 point clouds per second.  This representation is illustrated by the RoseClip directory consisting of 115 point clouds rendered at 24 point clouds per second with a 4.79 second display time.  Each file consists of 65K points (FLS coordinates).
