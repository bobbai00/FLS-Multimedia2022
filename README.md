# FLS-Multimedia2022
This repository contains MATLAB implementation of Flying Light Speck (FLS) concepts presented in our ACM Multimedia 2022 paper.  In addition, it includes the Rose Clip consisting of 115 point clouds with each point cloud consisting of 65K FLSs.  

The algorithms included are for computing flight path of FLSs to render a single point cloud (MinDist and QuotaBalanced) and a motion illumination consisting of a sequence of point clouds (Motill).  

Both the algorithms and the Rose Clip data are described in a paper that appeared in the ACM Multimedia 2022 paper.  An extended arXiv version of the paper is available at http:
