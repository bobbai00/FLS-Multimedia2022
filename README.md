# FLS-Multimedia2022
This repository contains MATLAB implementation of Flying Light Speck (FLS) concepts presented in our ACM Multimedia 2022 paper.  In addition, it includes the Rose Clip data set consisting of 115 point clouds with each point cloud consisting of 65K FLSs.

# Features

  * Two algorithms to deploy FLSs to illuminate a single point cloud:  MinDist and QuotaBalanced.
  * One algorithm to compute flight path of FLSs to illuminate motion illuminations consisting of a sequence of point clouds:  Motill.
  * All algorithms implemented using MATLAB R2022a academic edition. 
  * Rose Clip data set consisting of 115 point clouds.
  * The algorithms are detailed in a paper that appeared in the ACM Multimedia 2022 paper.  An extended arXiv version of the paper is available at https:
